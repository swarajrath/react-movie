## üè≠ Contribute

This is one of my side projects which I made to learn the following:

- React (Fundamentals)
- Context API (For state management)
- Tailwind CSS (An utility first CSS Framework)
- Material UI (A set of pre-made react components)
- And many little _reacty_ things...

So, if you're interested in movies, **this project is dedicated to you.** Give this a ‚≠ê if you liked!

## üéâ Getting Started

Make sure you fork it, to make your copy of the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/swarajrath/react-movie.git`

Now it's damn easy.

**Install the dependencies (using `npm` or `yarn`**

- Using `npm`: `npm install`
- Using `yarn`: `yarn`

**Starting project locally**

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

**Extra information**

- You can run `start` command just to run the react project and see how it works.


And of course, this couldn't have been possible without the great _free to use_ API called, **NetflixCLI**.
Their service has been amazing throughout and you can use their API to create your own projects too!
